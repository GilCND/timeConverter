# timeConverter
## Project developed during my programming course
### Write an objective-c class called MyTime that stores a field called minutes. Within the main method, have the user enter the time in minutes (using scanf) and  store it. Display the entered value as whole hours and minutes (i.e. 90 minutes is 1 hour and 30 minutes).
